# SMS Spam Collection - Spam Classifier using NLP
  This is a beginner-friendly NLP project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Python and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
# Dataset
 - Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)
 - Contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'.
# Libraries Used
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - sklearn
 - nltk
# Steps Followed
  1. Loaded and explored the dataset
  2. Preprocessed the text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
  3. Converted text data into numerical form using **CountVectorizer**
  4. Split the data into training and testing sets
  5. Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier
  6. Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall
# Output
  - Achieved **over 97% accuracy** on the test dataset.
  - The model can now predict whether a new SMS is spam or not.
